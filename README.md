# nes-boilerplate

This boilerplate is a simple starting point (with comments) to get you started
fast.

## How to use

This makefile uses the `ca65` compiler and the `ld65` linker to generate the
`.nes` file out of the objects file generated by the compiler.

It's pretty simple, the `Makefile` should do the trick for a bit:
```
make
```
That will generate a `boilerplate.nes` file that can be run in your favorite
emulator as is, but the point of this boilerplate is to fit your project so
few modifications should be done.

The `Makefile` also has a `build-docker`:
```
make build-docker
```
That will use a docker image to run the build. This is intended for people who
don't want to bother installing `cc65` on their machine and want to use the
[docker-nes-devkit](https://www.github.com/ganitzsh/docker-nes-devkit) that I
created.
